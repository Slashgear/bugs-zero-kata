> Kata to learn agile refactoring

## Install

```sh
pnpm install
```

## Run tests

```sh
pnpm test
```

## Steps
 1. Group in team (2 or 3)

 2. Analyse code and the game represented

 3. Refactor sprints


Analyse code and in 10 minutes gather 3 refactoring ideas.

They could be very simple or very risky.

Write each of them on post-it. Keep only the ones which would take less than 10 minutes to implement.

:warning: With your group, sort your refactor ideas by this rule:

>  - need fewer effort/impact
   - best protection from bugs

Present your first refactor on the board (if it has already been presented, present your second or third)

With all teams, discuss about all the refactors and vote for one.

 4. Implement previously elected refactor

 5. **GOTO** Step 3 and iterate
